# Chests 'n' Keys

## What is this game?

Chests 'n' Keys is a simple "game" that I made to teach myself the ropes of Archipelago. You have anywhere from 1 to
256 chests, each of which has an item inside. If you choose to enable keys, each chest is locked and must be unlocked
by its respective key. You win the game once you open all of the chests!

## What is considered a location in Chests 'n' Keys?

Each of your chests is a location. In addition, there's a location outside of the chests called the Desk, which is
always accessible regardless of whether keys are enabled. Location checks are sent whenever you open a chest or when
you click on the Desk item to collect it.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

There are two types of items: keys and Items That Do Nothing. If you have keys enabled, you will receive both;
otherwise, you will only receive Items That Do Nothing. When you obtain a key, you can use it to unlock its
corresponding chest.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## Wait... doesn't this all sound familiar?

Yes, it does. That's because this is basically just Clique, but the big red button is a chest and there are multiple
chests.
